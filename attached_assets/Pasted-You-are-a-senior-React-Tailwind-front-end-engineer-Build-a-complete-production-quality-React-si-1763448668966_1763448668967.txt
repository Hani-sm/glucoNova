You are a senior React + Tailwind front-end engineer.

Build a complete, production-quality React single-page application called **GlucoNova** that visually matches the following description. Use **Vite + React + TypeScript** if possible, otherwise plain React. Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Recharts** for charts, and **Lucide-react** (or similar) for icons.

====================================
APP OVERVIEW & THEME
====================================
The app is a modern AI-based diabetes dashboard with multiple screens:

1. Login page
2. Sign-up / Create account page
3. Role selection page (Patient vs Healthcare Provider)
4. Main patient dashboard
5. Alternative dashboard / health overview screen with more tiles
6. Shared layout with a left sidebar navigation and glassmorphism cards

Global visual style:
- Dark, medical, futuristic look
- Background: deep navy gradient with soft, subtle circular particles
  - From #020817 / #050b13 to #071629 / #0b2235
- Cards: dark blue–gray with glassmorphism, rounded corners (18–22px), subtle borders and blurred backgrounds:
  - Card background: rgba(15, 27, 45, 0.95)
  - Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06)
  - Shadow: 0 18px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.45)
- Primary accent color (buttons, highlights, pills): **#16A34A** / #22c55e (green)
- Secondary accent (labels, small tags): teal #22d3ee or #21E6C1
- Muted text: rgba(255,255,255,0.65)
- Font: system sans (match something like Inter / SF)

Implement a small “particle/halo” effect in the background using absolutely positioned blurred circles with low opacity.

====================================
APP STRUCTURE & ROUTING
====================================
Use React Router.

Routes:
- `/login` – login page
- `/signup` – create account page
- `/role-selection` – role selection after signup
- `/dashboard` – main patient dashboard (screenshot with “Welcome back, Hanisha SM”)
- `/patient` – variant view for glucose trends (screenshot with Glucose 112 mg/dL in top left)
- You can reuse the same layout for `/dashboard` and `/patient` with different data.

Create a `Layout` component that provides:
- Left sidebar
- Main content area with scroll
- Consistent background gradient

====================================
LEFT SIDEBAR (COMMON)
====================================
Sticky vertical sidebar on the left, width ~260px.

Top section:
- Circular avatar badge with initials “GN”, background solid green.
- App name **GlucoNova** in white, subtitle “AI Diabetes Management” or “AI Diabetes” in muted color.

Below that, a user card:
- Rounded rectangle with user avatar circle with letter “H”
- User name “Hanisha SM”
- Status line “Diabetes in Range: 85%” in green text.

Navigation items (icon + label), vertical list with good spacing:
- Dashboard
- My Details
- My Doctors
- Glucose
- Insulin
- Food AI
- Medications
- Voice AI
- Records
- Reports
- Settings

Each nav item: icon on the left, text on the right; highlight the active one with a pill background and green border or glow.

Bottom: a red “Logout” item.

====================================
LOGIN PAGE (/login)
====================================
Centered card in the middle of the screen.

Card:
- Width ~420px
- Glassmorphism style as described above
- Title: “GlucoNova” (white, bold)
- Subtitle under it: “Login” in green.

Form fields:
- Label: Email Address
- Input: full width, rounded, dark gray background (#111827), border 1px solid #1f2937
- Label: Password
- Input: same styling; right-aligned eye icon for “show/hide password” (functionality optional).
- Under password: row with:
  - Left: checkbox “Remember me”
  - Right: green text link “Forgot password?”
- Large green “Sign In” button full width, rounded, with hover shadow.
- Under button: “Don’t have an account? Create one” with “Create one” as a clickable green link that navigates to `/signup`.
- At the very bottom: centered footer text “© 2025 GlucoNova. All rights reserved.”

Make the login actually navigate to `/role-selection` on successful mock submit (no real auth required).

====================================
SIGN-UP PAGE (/signup)
====================================
Use similar centered card and background as login.

Inside card:
- Title: “Create Account”
- Inputs stacked vertically:
  - Email
  - Password
  - Confirm Password
- A section labeled “I am a *” with two pill buttons side by side:
  - Left: “Patient” (selected by default)
  - Right: “Healthcare Provider”
  The selected option should be solid green with white text; the other one should be outlined.
- Under the role selection, small muted description text:
  “Manage your diabetes with personalized predictions” when Patient is selected.
  “Access patient records and provide remote care” when Healthcare Provider is selected.
- Gray info box card below:
  “Your account will be reviewed by our admin team. You’ll receive an email notification upon approval.”
- Large green “Create Account” button full width.
- Under that: “Already have an account? Log in” with “Log in” as a green link back to `/login`.

On submit, navigate to `/role-selection`.

====================================
ROLE SELECTION PAGE (/role-selection)
====================================
Full width screen using layout background but without sidebar – just a centered large card.

Card:
- Title centered: “GlucoNova”
- Subtitle: “Select Your Role”
- Small subtext: “Choose how you’ll use GlucoNova”

Below, two big role cards horizontally aligned (responsive: stack on mobile):

Card 1 – Patient Account:
- Icon: user circle in a teal circle.
- Badge at top: pill with label “PATIENT”.
- Title: “Patient Account”
- Description: “Manage your diabetes with AI-powered insights”
- Green text link at bottom: “Click to continue as Patient”.
- Clicking this card or link goes to `/dashboard`.

Card 2 – Healthcare Provider:
- Icon: stethoscope in a teal circle.
- Badge: “PROVIDER”.
- Title: “Healthcare Provider”
- Description: “Access patient records and provide remote care”.
- Similar link “Click to continue as Provider” (can also route to `/dashboard` or a placeholder).

Below the two cards, a text link “← Back to Login” that goes to `/login`.

====================================
PATIENT DASHBOARD (/dashboard) – “Welcome back, Hanisha SM”
====================================
Use the shared layout with left sidebar + main content.

Main content top:
- Big heading: “Welcome back, Hanisha SM”
- Subheading: “Here’s your health overview for today”

Under heading, a row of 4 summary cards (full width; each card ~25% width on large screens, wrapping on smaller screens):

Card 1 – Glucose:
- Icon: drop or flame icon in a soft colored square.
- Big number: `112` with unit `mg/dL`.
- Status: “In Range” pill in green.
  
Card 2 – Time in Range:
- Big `85%`
- Status text: “Excellent +12%”
- Small icon.

Card 3 – Carbs:
- `45g`
- Status: “On Track • 25% used”.

Card 4 – Active Insulin:
- `2.5U`
- Status: “Active • -1.2U”

Middle section: a large Glucose Trends card:
- Title: “Glucose Trends”
- At top right of the card, time-range selector pills: **6h | 24h | 7d | 30d**
  - 24h selected, green background.
- Inside card, use a **Recharts LineChart** showing glucose trend over time (use mock data array of { time: "12 AM", value: 95 } etc.)
- X-axis: times of day (12AM, 3AM, 6AM, 9AM, 12PM, 3PM, 6PM, 9PM, 12AM)
- Y-axis: mg/dL
- Points connected with green line, glowing point dots.
- Footer inside card: 
  - Left: “Current Status” label
  - Right: “98 mg/dL” with pill “Within Target”

Right side of this main section: two vertical cards stacked.

Top right card – Voice Food Logging:
- Header: icon representing food or microphone.
- Title: “Voice Food Logging”
- Body: large, soft, dark rectangle with hint text “Tap mic to log your meal”
- Orange rounded button: “Log Meal”.
- Optional: small tooltip/label at top right.

Bottom right card – Streaks / Activity:
- Title: nothing or small label.
- Three horizontal progress rows:
  - “3 Days in Range” 100%
  - “Weekly Logging” 85%
  - “Activity Goal” 70%
- Each row: label on left, percentage on right, progress bar below in teal/green.

Bottom of dashboard (optional extra section, can scroll): quick action tiles similar to your extra screenshot:

- Card group with 4–6 tiles:
  - Blood Sugar Tracking
  - Medication Reminders
  - Doctor Communication
  - Health Reports
  Each tile: icon, title, short description, all inside a rounded card.

====================================
ALTERNATE DASHBOARD VIEW (/patient)
====================================
Another page using similar layout but slightly different arrangement:

- Top row: four stat cards (Glucose, Time in Range, Carbs, Active Insulin) arranged horizontally like in the first screenshot (patient view).
- Under that: big “Glucose Trends” card (same as above, but maybe with different data).
- Right: same Voice Food Logging and 3 Days in Range/Weekly Logging/Activity Goal card stack.

You can reuse most components; just feed different mock data.

====================================
COMPONENTIZATION
====================================
Create reusable components:

- `Sidebar`
- `StatCard` – props: title, value, unit, chip text, icon, chip color.
- `TrendCard` – contains the Recharts line chart and time filters.
- `ProgressCard` – contains the three progress bars.
- `VoiceLoggingCard`
- `QuickActionCard`
- `RoleCard`
- `AuthCard` – used by login and signup pages.

Make everything responsive:
- On small screens, sidebar collapses to a top bar or narrow icon-only bar.
- Cards stack vertically.

====================================
DATA & INTERACTION
====================================
No real backend is required; use mock data and `useState`:

- For the glucose trends, store arrays for each time range (6h, 24h, 7d, 30d) and switch chart data when the range pill is clicked.
- For role selection, keep a state `selectedRole`.
- For signup role toggle (Patient / Healthcare Provider), highlight the active role and show different description text.
- For login, on form submit simply `navigate("/role-selection")`.

====================================
STYLING DETAILS
====================================
Use Tailwind where possible:

- Page background: `bg-gradient-to-b from-[#020817] via-[#050b13] to-[#071629]`
- Cards: `bg-[#0b1724]/90 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl shadow-2xl shadow-black/40 backdrop-blur-xl`
- Buttons: `bg-gradient-to-b from-emerald-500 to-emerald-600 text-white rounded-xl font-semibold hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-emerald-500/30 transition`
- Pills: `px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium bg-emerald-500/10 text-emerald-300 border border-emerald-500/40`
- Progress bars: container `bg-white/5 rounded-full`, inner `bg-emerald-400 h-2 rounded-full`.

Labels and texts should mirror a modern SaaS dashboard: big titles, medium-weight stat numbers, smaller muted subtitles.

====================================
DELIVERABLE
====================================
Return all necessary files for a runnable Replit project:
- `package.json` with React, React Router, Tailwind, Recharts, Lucide.
- `index.html`, `main.tsx` / `main.jsx`, `App.tsx` / `App.jsx`.
- Components and pages as described.
- Tailwind configuration.
- Minimal CSS for the background particles if needed.

The final app should closely visually match the screenshots described: dark navy background, glass cards, green/teal accents, left sidebar, patient dashboard with glucose trends, quick actions, login, signup, and role selection flow.
