Reference: file:///mnt/data/0c6e8b9e-b0ed-43ec-b7da-3f13f14ed063.png — use this file as the single source of truth for proportions, spacing, icon sizes and the glassy look.

Goal: Recreate the left navigation bar exactly as shown (dark glass style) and include a Settings item. Keep the app background unchanged — only build the sidebar component. Produce a pixel-accurate, production-ready sidebar (HTML/CSS or React + Tailwind).

Global sidebar specs

Fixed width: 240px. Height: full viewport (100vh). Position: sticky / fixed on left. Padding: 24px top & sides. Border radius: 12px on inner cards only; outer sidebar flush to the edge.

Background: semi-opaque glass (rgba(7,12,15,0.7)) with backdrop-blur-sm and subtle inner teal vignette to match reference. Add a faint left-inner highlight and very soft drop shadow. Do not change background of the page; sidebar must visually integrate with existing background.

Scroll: vertical scrollbar visible inside sidebar for overflow; slim track with teal accent.

Header & profile block (top)

App logo circle + app name “GlucoNova” stacked: logo 40px circle with teal gradient, app name to the right or below depending on space.

User pill block: 48px circle avatar (initial), user name Hanisha SM (or user), role/short status below in small text (e.g., “Diabetes” and In Range: 85% in teal). The profile block sits inside a rounded rectangle with subtle inner shadow and padding.

Navigation items (list & order — exact text)

Dashboard (with grid icon) — active state indicator (small white dot on the right).

My Details (person icon)

My Doctors (heart icon)

Glucose (wave/graph icon)

Insulin (drop/syringe icon)

Food AI (fork & knife icon)

Medications (pill icon)

Voice AI (microphone icon)

Settings (gear icon) — new item to include at bottom of nav list, above the two bottom action buttons.

Navigation styling

Icon size: ~20–22px. Spacing: 14–16px between icon and label. Vertical spacing between items: 20px. Text: 15px medium, color #CAD6D4 (muted near-white).

Hover: slightly lighter text and a faint teal left accent bar (4px) that animates in. Active item shows a small white circle/dot on the right and stronger background highlight (glass highlight).

Each nav row: accessible button (role=button or anchor) with aria-current for active. Keyboard focus ring visible.

Bottom action buttons

Two rounded square buttons at bottom (full width or two inline small buttons as in ref): left = voice/mic button, right = upload/share button. Each: 48px tall, pill corners, subtle teal glow. Include small labels hidden on narrow widths.

Add Logout link in small red text at very bottom-left outside or below sidebar content (per reference).

Settings item behaviour

Clicking Settings opens a right-side panel (drawer) or modal (choose drawer if supported) with user preferences: Theme (Light/Dark), Notifications toggle, Units (mg/dL | mmol/L), Data & Privacy (export/import), Onboarding reset (re-run tutorial). Drawer width ~420px, glass style matching sidebar.

Settings should be keyboard accessible and persist changes to localStorage (mocked ok).

Micro-interactions & accessibility

All nav items focusable (Tab), with visible focus outline, and aria-labels. Use role="navigation" and aria-label="Main sidebar".

Tooltips on icons when collapsed or on hover (e.g., Dashboard, Glucose).

Tailwind/CSS hints (optional)

Sidebar wrapper: w-[240px] h-screen p-6 bg-[rgba(7,12,15,0.7)] backdrop-blur-sm shadow-sm

Profile card: rounded-lg p-4 bg-[rgba(11,18,20,0.55)]

Nav item: flex items-center gap-4 py-3 px-2 rounded-md hover:bg-[rgba(33,200,155,0.03)] focus:outline-none

Active indicator (right): w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-white ml-auto

Bottom buttons: flex gap-3 mt-auto with each w-12 h-12 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center

Deliverables expected

A high-fidelity sidebar component matching the provided image exactly (desktop).

HTML/CSS or React + Tailwind implementation snippet for immediate paste into Replit.

Settings drawer mock UI (no backend required), and notes on how to persist preferences.

Hard constraint: match icons, spacing, and visual weight exactly to the provided reference and include the Settings item & drawer. Do not change the global page background or main content area.
