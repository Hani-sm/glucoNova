Reference: file:///mnt/data/8ceb11e9-fe9b-4335-abb1-75950fd05299.png — use this file as the single source of truth for current output. Improve and refine the sidebar to match the intended polished GlucoNova sidebar shown previously (glassy, premium dark theme). Do not change the page background or main content — only modify the sidebar component.

Primary goal: keep the exact structure but fix visual details so the sidebar looks like the polished design: larger profile card with avatar glow, stronger active item highlight (left rounded teal bar + right dot), increased icon/text sizes and spacing, bottom action buttons larger and centered, Logout text small/red at bottom-left.

Exact layout & dimensions

Sidebar width: 240px (fixed). Height: full viewport. Padding: 24px top/right/left.

Profile card: a full-width rounded rectangle inside the sidebar with padding: 16px, border-radius: 14px, subtle inner shadow and a soft teal vignette. Avatar circle: 48px with a faint teal halo/glow (outer shadow 0 8px 24px rgba(33,200,155,0.12)). Username text: 16–18px semi-bold; role/status below in 13px muted teal (e.g., In Range: 85%).

Navigation list (exact order & visual corrections)

Items (top → bottom): Dashboard, My Details, My Doctors, Glucose, Insulin, Food AI, Medications, Voice AI, Settings.

Icon size: 22px. Label font-size: 16px (medium). Vertical spacing between items: 18–22px.

Active item styling (very important): a rounded left accent bar (width 6px, radius on top/bottom matching item) in teal #21C89B that sits flush to the left edge of the item. The active item itself should have a slightly darker glass background and a small white circular dot on the far right (10px diameter). Replicate the rounded pill effect shown in the polished design.

Hover state: item background lightly brightens (glass highlight) and the left accent bar animates in (translate from left, 120ms). Focus state: visible focus ring (semi-opaque teal).

Icons & labels

Use simplified, rounded line icons consistent with the reference (grid for Dashboard, person for My Details, heart for My Doctors, pulse for Glucose, drop/syringe for Insulin, fork/knife for Food AI, pill for Medications, mic for Voice AI, gear for Settings). Ensure icon stroke weight matches label weight visually.

All labels vertically center with their icons and use consistent 14–16px left padding between icon and text.

Bottom actions & logout

Two big rounded action buttons at the bottom inside a padded container (separate from nav list): each 64px tall × 120px wide (or square 64px if constrained), large radius, glass-dark background with centered teal icon. Add a subtle inset highlight and glow. Space them horizontally with gap: 16px. Place these buttons centered horizontally above the Logout link (not flush to the very bottom).

Logout: small red text link placed bottom-left beneath the action buttons area, font-size 13px, color #FF6B6B. Keep it separated from the nav list by comfortable spacing.

Spacing & rhythm

Ensure generous vertical rhythm. Top group (logo + profile) separated from nav items by 18–22px. Nav group should not be cramped — use consistent 18–22px spacing. The nav list should end above the bottom action area leaving comfortable breathing space.

Colors & tokens

Sidebar glass: rgba(7,12,15,0.72) with backdrop-blur(8px) and subtle teal vignette.

Accent teal: #21C89B for left bar, halo, badges and icons highlight.

Label color: near-white #EAF6F3 for headings, muted #9AA8A6 for secondary text.

Active dot: pure white circle #FFFFFF (10px).

Accessibility & interactions

All nav items keyboard accessible (role=button/anchor). Active item must have aria-current="page". Tooltip text for icons when collapsed. Modal/drawer open/close (for Settings) keyboard-accessible and focus-trapped.

Settings behavior

Clicking Settings opens a right-side drawer (glass style) width 420px with theme toggle, units (mg/dL | mmol/L), notifications toggle, and Reset Onboarding button. Drawer should overlay content and be dismissible with ESC. Persist changes to localStorage (mock persistence acceptable).

Deliverables expected from generator

Updated sidebar component visually matching the specs above.

A short HTML/CSS or React+Tailwind snippet implementing the active left accent, active dot, profile card glow, bottom action buttons and settings drawer (mock behavior OK).

Notes on which classes/variables to tweak if the main page background differs.

Hard constraint: only change the sidebar visuals — do not alter the global page background, main content area, or chart/other widgets.
