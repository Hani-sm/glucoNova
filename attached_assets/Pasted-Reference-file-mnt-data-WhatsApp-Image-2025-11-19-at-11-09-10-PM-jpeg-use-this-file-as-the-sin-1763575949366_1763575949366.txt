Reference: file:///mnt/data/WhatsApp Image 2025-11-19 at 11.09.10 PM.jpeg — use this file as the single source of truth for proportions, spacing, colors and the background.

Goal: Recreate the GlucoNova patient dashboard exactly as in the reference (desktop view). Keep the background (dark navy, teal particles, wave-lines and glow) unchanged. Match the wider desktop aspect, card sizes, spacing, and visual weight from the reference. Produce a high-fidelity, production-ready dashboard layout (HTML/CSS or React + Tailwind if possible).

Layout constraints:

Page width: center main content with max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 24px.

Left sidebar: fixed width 240px, full height, glass style, icons + labels stacked.

Header: fixed 72px height. Title centered-left, profile pill on the right.

Main grid: two columns — main column (1fr) + right column (360px), gap: 28px.

Card sizes & positions (match reference):

Top metrics row (inside main column): four equal cards, each height: 110px, rounded corners (12px).

Glucose Trends chart card: full width of main column, height: 360px, rounded corners 12px. Smooth line chart with teal stroke and translucent area fill.

Right column widgets: widths fixed at 360px. Example heights: AI widget 120px, Voice Log 220px, Goals 160px.

Quick Actions: full-width cards below chart spanning main column, each ~80–100px tall.

Visual tokens (exact look):

Background: do not change — match reference exactly.

Primary card background: semi-opaque glass rgba(10,18,21,0.62) with backdrop-blur.

Accent teal: #21C89B (icons, chart line, progress bars).

Muted text: #9AA8A6. Headings near-white: #EAF6F3.

Border radius: 12px–14px on cards. Subtle inner highlight and soft shadow for depth.

Chart & data behavior:

Smooth spline line with dots at points, dotted horizontal grid lines, x-axis times from 12 AM → 12 AM, y-axis 60–150 mg/dL. Use a gradient under the line (teal → transparent).

Top stat cards: include small icon, large metric (e.g., 112 mg/dL), and a small pill (e.g. “In Range”, “No Data”). If no data show --.

Microinteractions & accessibility:

Card hover: subtle scale + soft teal glow. Focusable with visible focus ring. Modal/controls accessible by keyboard.

Buttons: primary CTA teal with subtle shadow and keyboard focus outline.

Responsive rules:

Desktop: two-column grid as specified.

Tablet/mobile: collapse to single column; sidebar collapses to icon-only or becomes a hamburger.

Deliverables expected:

A high-fidelity HTML/CSS or React + Tailwind layout that visually matches the reference (desktop).

Tailwind class suggestions for grid and card sizes (example: max-w-[1400px] mx-auto px-6 grid grid-cols-[1fr_360px] gap-7, sidebar w-[240px], chart h-[360px]).

Mocked data for top-stat cards, chart points and progress bars so the generator can render the same look.

Optional (if supported): include a mock onboarding tooltip or modal stub (non-intrusive) that can be toggled for demo purposes — but do not alter the dashboard default state.

Hard constraint reminder: Do not change the background image/particles/waves — only match layout widths, card sizes, spacing and details to reproduce the same dashboard design as in the referenced file.
