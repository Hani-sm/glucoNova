Act as a senior full-stack React developer.
Build a pixel-perfect clone of a dark themed diabetes dashboard web app called “GlucoNova”.
Use this tech stack:
Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS (no inline styles, no CSS modules)
Routing: React Router
Charts: Recharts (or another simple React chart library if needed)
State: Local React state only (no Redux)
The app must have the following pages, layout and visual style, closely matching these screenshots:
Dark blue/teal GlucoNova login screen with a centered glass card
Role selection screen (Patient vs Healthcare Provider)
Dashboard with left sidebar + top metrics cards + glucose trend graph + quick actions + voice assistant card
Register / create account form with patient vs provider toggle
Additional dashboard view with “Glucose Trends” line chart and summary stats
GLOBAL STYLE & THEME
General background: dark navy gradient from #040815 to #071627.
Add very subtle floating circular particles in the background (low opacity, teal or light blue). This can be simple absolutely positioned divs, no need for complex animations.
Card background: very dark bluish gray, e.g. #121826 to #1b2436.
Card border radius: 18–24px.
Accent colors:
Primary green for success: #16a34a
Teal/emerald for highlights: #10b981
Orange for CTA buttons (like “Log Meal”): #f97316
Typography: use system font stack or Tailwind’s default; headings should be semibold/bold, body text normal.
Use soft drop shadows on cards: e.g. shadow-xl with low opacity.
APP STRUCTURE
Implement a layout with:
MainLayout (for logged-in pages)
Left sidebar:
Top: round avatar with initials inside a green circle, app name “GlucoNova” next to it.
Below: user card showing name (e.g. “Hanisha SM”) and a tag like “Diabetes in Range: 85%”.
Navigation items as a vertical list with icons:
Dashboard
My Details
My Doctors
Glucose
Insulin
Food AI
Medications
Voice AI
Records
Reports
Settings
Bottom: “Logout” in red.
Right content area for the dashboard cards and graphs.
PublicLayout (for login/register/role selection)
Same dark gradient background with floating dots.
Centered card or content panel.
Use React Router routes:
/login
/register
/role-selection
/dashboard
Default route / should redirect to /login.
PAGE 1 – LOGIN PAGE (/login)
Centered vertical card with glassmorphism effect:
Width around 420px.
Background: semi-transparent dark (bg-slate-900/70), border border-white/10, backdrop-blur.
Content:
Title: GlucoNova (large, white, centered).
Subtitle: Login in teal/green.
Form fields:
Email Address (label above, filled rounded input inside the card).
Password (label above, filled rounded input).
Row with:
Left: checkbox “Remember me”
Right: teal link “Forgot password?”
Full-width green button: Sign In.
Below: “Don’t have an account? Create one” with “Create one” as clickable teal link that goes to /register.
At bottom of page: “© 2025 GlucoNova. All rights reserved.” centered with low opacity.
No real auth needed: on submit just preventDefault and navigate to /role-selection.
PAGE 2 – ROLE SELECTION (/role-selection)
Centered large transparent card with blurred background.
Title: GlucoNova (top center).
Subheading: “Select Your Role” and smaller sub-text: “Choose how you’ll use GlucoNova”.
Two big cards in a row:
Patient Account card:
Icon circle on top with a user icon.
Badge “PATIENT”.
Title “Patient Account”.
Description: “Manage your diabetes with AI-powered insights”.
At bottom, a small teal link: “Click to continue as Patient”.
Healthcare Provider card:
Stethoscope icon circle.
Badge “PROVIDER”.
Title “Healthcare Provider”.
Description: “Access patient records and provide remote care”.
Hover effect: slightly raise and brighten card.
Clicking a card should navigate("/dashboard").
Below the cards, a small back link: “← Back to Login” that goes to /login.
PAGE 3 – REGISTER / CREATE ACCOUNT (/register)
Use a similar narrow centered card as login.
Title: “Create Your GlucoNova Account”.
Fields:
Email
Password
Confirm Password
Role toggle: Patient vs Healthcare Provider as two side-by-side pill buttons. Selected one is filled green, other is outlined.
Text under role: “Manage your diabetes with personalized predictions” when “Patient” is selected; and a provider-related text when “Healthcare Provider” is selected.
Info box card below:
Light border and small text: “Your account will be reviewed by our admin team. You’ll receive an email notification upon approval.”
Big green button: Create Account.
Below: “Already have an account? Log in” link that navigates to /login.
No backend logic, just fake success and navigate to /role-selection.
PAGE 4 – MAIN DASHBOARD (/dashboard) – PATIENT VIEW
Use MainLayout with sidebar on the left and main content on the right.
Top Welcome Section
At top of content, a large headline:
Welcome back, Hanisha SM
Smaller text: “Here’s your health overview for today”.
Row of 4 metric cards (full width)
Each card rectangle has:
Glucose
Big number: 112
Unit: mg/dL
Small text: In Range
Time in Range
Big number: 85%
Small text: Excellent • +12%
Carbs
Big number: 45g
Small text: On Track • 25% used
Active Insulin
Big number: 2.5U
Small text: Active • -1.2U
Each card uses an icon in the top-right (drop icon for glucose, bullseye for time-in-range, fork/knife for carbs, syringe for insulin).
Add small status labels as rounded pills (e.g. “In Range”, “Excellent”, “On Track”, “Active”) in green.
Glucose Trends Card
Big card with title: “Glucose Trends”.
Top right: toggle segmented control with 4 buttons: 6h, 24h, 7d, 30d. The selected one is green; others are dark.
Main body: line chart (Recharts) showing glucose values across time-of-day (x-axis: 12 AM, 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 12 AM).
Use light green line with round dots and subtle area fill.
Bottom: summary row:
“Current Status 98 mg/dL” with badge “Within Target”.
Right Columns – Voice + Stats
On the right side of this view (or below on smaller screens) add stacked cards:
Voice Food Logging / Voice Health Assistant card
Title: “Voice Food Logging” or “Voice Health Assistant”.
Inside: microphone icon in a circle.
Subtext “Tap mic to log your meal” or “Tap microphone to record health data”.
Button: orange Log Meal or green Record.
Recognized text area below (mock): “Recognized: Glucose 120, BMI 24.5, Age 45”.
Streak and goals card
Title: nothing big, just label + stats:
“3 Days in Range – 100%” with horizontal teal progress bar.
“Weekly Logging – 85%” progress bar.
“Activity Goal – 70%” progress bar.
Quick Actions Section (Alternative/Second View)
Another view or section similar to one of the screenshots:
Card titled “Quick Actions”.
Inside, a grid of cards (2 or 3 per row) for:
Blood Sugar Tracking
Medication Reminders
Doctor Communication
Health Reports
Each quick-action card has:
Icon on left (heart, pill, chat bubble, document)
Title and short description.
Use dummy data arrays for glucose values and progress percentages.
INTERACTIONS (FRONTEND ONLY)
Clicking Sign In on login → navigate to /role-selection.
On role selection, clicking a role card → navigate to /dashboard.
On dashboard, clicking the time range buttons (6h/24h/7d/30d) should change the dummy data used by the Glucose Trends chart (so the line graph visibly changes).
Voice cards and quick actions can just log to console with console.log when clicked; no real APIs needed.
CODE ORGANIZATION
Use a src/components folder for reusable pieces like:
Sidebar.tsx
MetricCard.tsx
GlucoseTrendChart.tsx
ProgressBar.tsx
QuickActionCard.tsx
VoiceAssistantCard.tsx
Use src/pages for:
LoginPage.tsx
RegisterPage.tsx
RoleSelectionPage.tsx
DashboardPage.tsx
App.tsx handles Router and layouts.
GOAL
Deliver a fully working React + Tailwind project that, when run in Replit, shows a polished GlucoNova interface with:
Pixel-perfect dark theme similar to modern health dashboards
All pages wired via routes
Responsive layout (sidebar collapses or the content stacks nicely on smaller screens)
Clean, well-structured TypeScript code and Tailwind classes only.
Do all necessary setup: Tailwind config, Router setup, chart library installation, and example data so the dashboard looks full and real.
